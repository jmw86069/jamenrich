\title{igraph re-layout using qgraph Fruchterman-Reingold}
\usage{
relayout_with_qfr(g, repulse = 3.5, spread_labels = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{\code{igraph} object}

\item{repulse}{exponent power used to scale the radius effect around
each vertex. The default is slightly higher than the cube of
the number of vertices, but as the number of vertices increases,
values from 3.5 to 4 and higher are more effective for layout.}

\item{spread_labels}{logical indicating whether to call
\code{spread_igraph_labels()}, which places node labels at an angle offset
from the node, in order to improve default label positions.}

\item{...}{additional arguments are passed to \code{layout_with_qfr()} and
\code{spread_igraph_labels()} as needed.}
}
\value{
\code{igraph} object, with layout coordinates stored in
\code{V(g)$x} and \code{V(g)$y}. When \code{spread_labels=TRUE},
\code{V(g)$label.degree} and \code{V(g)$label.dist} are updated
by calling \code{spread_igraph_labels()}.
}
\description{
igraph re-layout using qgraph Fruchterman-Reingold
}
\details{
This function extends \code{layout_with_qfr()} by applying the layout
to the \code{igraph} object itself, while also calling
\code{spread_igraph_labels()} to adjust label positions accordingly.

The main benefit to using this function is to update the layout
and node label positions in one step,
while also returning the \code{igraph} object ready to be plotted as-is.
