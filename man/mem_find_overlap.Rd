\arguments{
\item{mem}{\code{list} output from \code{multiEnrichMap()}}

\item{overlap_range}{numeric range of Jaccard overlap values}

\item{overlap_count}{numeric value passed to \code{mem_multienrichplot()}
which is used to filter the multienrichmap by Jaccard overlap
and by overlap_count.}

\item{max_cutoff}{numeric value between 0 and 1, to define the
maximum fraction of nodes in the largest connected component,
compared to the total number of non-singlet nodes.}

\item{debug}{logical indicating whether to return full debug
data, which is used internally to determine the best overlap
cutoff to use.}

\description{
Find best overlap threshold for EnrichMap
}
\details{
This function implements a straightforward approach to determine
a reasonable Jaccard overlap threshold for EnrichMap data.
It finds the overlap threshold at which the first connected
component is no more than \code{max_cutoff} fraction of the whole
network. This fraction is defined as the number of nodes in the
largest connected component, divided by the total number of
non-singlet nodes. When all nodes are connected, this fraction == 1.

We found empirically that a \code{max_cutoff=0.4}, the point at which the
largest connected component contains no more than 40\% of all nodes,
seems to be a reasonably good place to start.
